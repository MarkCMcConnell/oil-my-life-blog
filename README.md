# oil-my-life-blog
This website is created in part as a personal project for my portfolio, but also as the business website and blog that will be put in production.

In order to view this website and blog, follow these steps:

* `git clone` this repo to your system in your projects directory.
* Install NodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
* In the terminal enter `npm install` to install all libraries and dependencies in `package.json`.
* Install MongoDB version 3.4 for your OS from https://www.mongodb.com/.
* Run the Mongo CLI and enter `use <database name>`.
* Open a terminal window and run `nodemon app.js` from the root directory of the app directory.
* Open another terminal, if on Windows, and run `gulp watch`.
* The web app should load in your default browser.
